# Animal Shelter Intake and Outcome Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing animal shelter intake data to extract key insights. It includes year-wise, month-wise, and method-wise analysis of animal intakes, along with the integration of outcome data to evaluate animal dispositions.

## Key Features
- Cleaned dataset by handling null values and removing duplicates.
- Renamed columns for clarity and created new time-based features.
- Analyzed trends in animal intakes by year, month, and intake method.
- Explored animal types, intake conditions, and identified top breeds and names.
- Integrated outcome data (if available) to assess post-intake animal dispositions.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas Data cleaning and manipulation.
- NumPy Numerical operations.
- MatplotlibSeaborn (optional) For visualizing trends.

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset `contentdriveMyDrivedatasetDataSet_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv`.
2. Preprocess the data (handle nulls, drop duplicates, rename columns).
3. Perform the analysis as shown in the code, or customize for your own insights.

## Outputs
- Year-wise and month-wise animal intake trends.
- Breakdown of animal intake methods and conditions.
- Most common animal types, breeds, and names in the shelter.
- Outcome type analysis (if available).
